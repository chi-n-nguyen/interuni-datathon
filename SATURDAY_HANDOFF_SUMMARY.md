# SATURDAY ANALYSIS HANDOFF - KEY FINDINGS

## WHAT I (PERSON 1) COMPLETED 

### Technical Analysis Done:
- **Environment Setup**: All libraries installed and tested
- **Data Quality Assessment**: 165 visitation records, 39K climate records, <5% missing data
- **Weather-Visitation Correlation**: BREAKTHROUGH findings on temperature sensitivity
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: 11 years of trends analyzed

### CRITICAL DISCOVERIES:

#### ** WEATHER FORMULA FOR SUCCESS:**
- **COLDER = MORE VISITORS** (ALL resorts show -0.23 to -0.39 correlation)
- **Optimal Temperature**: -1.6째C to 0.4째C (anything warmer kills attendance)
- **High visitor weeks average -0.6째C, low visitor weeks +1.5째C**

#### ** RESORT POWER RANKINGS:**
1. **Perisher**: 595K/year (weather sensitive -0.350)
2. **Thredbo**: 450K/year (MOST weather sensitive -0.385) 
3. **Mt. Buller**: 440K/year (great snow correlation +0.303)
4. **Falls Creek**: 360K/year (most consistent, 59% CV)

#### ** WEEK INSIGHTS:**
- **Peak Weeks**: 5-6 (280K+ visitors) and 10-11 (260K+)
- **Value Weeks**: 1-3 (50-90K visitors) and 13-15 (100-140K)
- **Week 6 is THE peak across most resorts**

### DATA FILES CREATED:
- `weather_visitation_combined.csv` - 1,292 records for modeling
- `data_quality_check.py` - Quality assessment script
- `weather_mapping_analysis.py` - Station to resort mapping
- `weather_visitation_correlation.py` - Correlation analysis
- `historical_patterns_analysis.py` - Historical trends

## WHAT PERSON 2 NEEDS TO RESEARCH 

### TOP PRIORITY RESORTS (Based on my analysis):
Focus deep research on these 4-5 finalists:
1. **Thredbo** - Premium, weather-sensitive
2. **Perisher** - Biggest, family-friendly 
3. **Mt. Buller** - Great snow response
4. **Falls Creek** - Most consistent
5. **Mt. Hotham** - Boutique, cold-loving

### EXTERNAL DATA NEEDED:
- **Flight costs** from Sydney/Melbourne to each resort area
- **Accommodation pricing** (2026 estimates)
- **Lift ticket prices** and season pass options
- **2026 school holidays** NSW/VIC (critical for Week 5-6 predictions)
- **Unique resort features** (terrain, village, accessibility)

### 2026 CONTEXT RESEARCH:
- **Economic factors** affecting ski tourism
- **Climate predictions** for 2026 winter
- **Major events** during ski season
- **Resort improvements/changes** planned for 2026

## SUNDAY PRIORITIES 

### JOINT TASKS:
- **12PM**: Decide final resort and week recommendation
- **Build 2026 weather prediction** models 
- **Create cost-benefit analysis** framework
- **Design compelling presentation** narrative

### SUCCESS METRICS:
 Clear optimal week AND resort identified 
 Weather prediction for 2026 ski season 
 Total cost analysis (flights + accommodation + lift tickets) 
 Compelling 5-minute story that makes judges want to book the trip

## KEY QUESTIONS FOR PERSON 2:

1. **Which resort offers best VALUE** (experience per dollar)?
2. **How do accommodation costs vary** by resort and week?
3. **What makes each resort unique** beyond visitor numbers?
4. **Any 2026 special events** that could affect our recommendation?

## WINNING COMBINATION HYPOTHESIS:
**Week 5-6 at Thredbo or Mt. Buller** - peak conditions, premium experience, strong weather correlation

Ready to dominate Sunday!
